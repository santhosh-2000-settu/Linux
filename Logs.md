#  Logs

Linux maintains various log files to help administrators track system
activities and troubleshoot issues. Below is an explanation of some
common log files and their purposes:

- **/var/log/messages**: This is the primary log file that records a
  wide range of system events, including boot messages, service startup
  and shutdown, and general system errors.
